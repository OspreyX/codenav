# CodeNav

CodeNav is a Chrome extension and Firefox addon that makes navigating code on Github easier and more intuitive.  It borrows features from popular IDEs for more seamless movement around code.

## Install for Chrome or Firefox

Get the latest download links on the [CodeNav site](http://ianww.com/codenav).

## Running from source

Run `./setup_hardlinks` before you load the Chrome or Firefox plugins.  This will connect the generic code in `src/` to the proper locations in the browser-specific subdirectories.  Unfortunately symlinks aren't loaded by the browsers.
